# Installation scripts

I always find myself looking up the install pages for every new machine setup.
I've aggregated my favorites here so all I need to do is `./*sh` to install
all my package-managed and non-package-managed tools.

Big Tools:

- [x] exa (replacement for ls)
- [x] tmux
- [x] vim
- [x] zsh

Small Tools, Components, and Prerequisites:

- [x] Oh-My-Zsh
- [x] Vundle (with components like Syntastic)
- [x] cmake
- [x] rust
- [x] cargo
